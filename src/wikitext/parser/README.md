This is a fork of Mediawiki's Parsoid project. It's a PEG-based parser that converts wikitext to a Javascript object.

This parser is a fork of [@msikma/wiki.ly](https://github.com/msikma/wiki.ly), intended for use inside of this project.

A single change was made to the compiled grammar to fix a greedy regex that incorrectly ended external links improperly.
